# osf

Experimental golang package for working with Open Screenplay Format 2.x.
Open Screenplay Format is an open XML format for screenplays and the
native format (when zipped) for [Fade In](https://www.fadeinpro.com).
This package also includes a demonstration command line program called
[osf2txt](docs/) which will read a osf file and render plain text in a 
[Fountain](https://fountain.io) like format.
